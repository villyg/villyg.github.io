Welcome! I’m a Chief Solutions Architect with a strong focus on building secure, scalable, and high-performing systems across cloud, DevOps, integrations, and healthcare IT. I lead enterprise architecture initiatives and work closely with engineering teams to turn complex challenges into practical, future-ready solutions.

On this blog, I share lessons from the field—real-world patterns, trade-offs, and strategies that come from leading architecture efforts at scale. Whether it’s cloud-native design, system modernization, or performance tuning, I enjoy breaking down big problems and exploring what works (and what doesn’t) in practice.

What I work on:

- Designing architecture strategies that align with business goals
- Leading and mentoring teams in cloud, DevOps, and platform engineering
- Driving evaluations, proof-of-concepts, and technology roadmaps
- Balancing build vs. buy decisions with long-term impact in mind
- Engaging with the tech community through talks, code, and collaboration
- My goal is to contribute to a better, more transparent tech culture—one where we share insights, ask hard questions, and keep learning. Thanks for stopping by.
